# Legal-NER-from-Indian-court-judgment-text.

Performed Legal Named Entity Recognition from a court judgemnent dataset to extract 14 key legal subjects/terms from the text. Implemented 4 different model architectures: RNN, LSTM, GRU network and a BiLSTM-CRF using Pytorch with 3 different pre-trained word embeddings each: fasttext, glove and word2vec and compared their performances. Achieved an accuracy of 0.94 and macro-F1 score of 0.78 on BiLSTM-CRF models with word2vec embedding.
